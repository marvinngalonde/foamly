## üìù Notes

### Supabase Storage Configuration
- **Bucket Name:** `foamy`
- **Folders:**
  - `profile_pics/` - User and provider profile pictures
  - `vehicles/` - Vehicle images
- **Image Format:** JPEG
- **Compression:** 0.8 quality
- **Aspect Ratio:** 1:1 (square) for profile pictures

### TypeScript Considerations
- Used `as any` casts for accessing fields not in global type definitions (e.g., `profilePicture`, `serviceArea`)
- API types differ from global types in `@/types`
- Consider unifying type definitions in future refactor

### Security
- RLS policies should be configured in Supabase for the `foamy` bucket
- Users should only be able to upload to their own folders
- Consider file size limits and validation

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Navigate to Profile tab
2. Tap camera icon on profile picture
3. Select image from gallery

### Search Providers

2. Use search bar to filter by service area

## üîê Required Supabase Policies

```sql
-- Storage policies for foamy bucket
-- Allow users to upload to their own profile_pics folder
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own profile pictures"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'foamy' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'profile_pics' AND
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.filename(name))
);

-- Allow public read access to images
CREATE POLICY "Public read access to images"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'foamy');
```
